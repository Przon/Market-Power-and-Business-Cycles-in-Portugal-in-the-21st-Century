# thesis-data

A collection of datasets and processed data used in my Master's thesis in Economics @ ISEG.

This folder contains the key datasets, transformations, and calculations that support my research. The data includes sectoral output, capital stock, labor, and markups, sourced from INE, AMECO, and the Bank of Portugal. It also includes processed versions of the data used in my OLS estimations.
